            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I grew up in Canton, MI, and later pursued my undergraduate studies at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where I earned a degree in Film, TV, and Media. Over the years, I’ve gained diverse experience working in various library settings as well as in culinary positions. Currently, I am working towards my Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) degree at Wayne State University, while also serving as a Library Assistant at the Cranbrook Educational Community. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my professional pursuits, I have a deep passion for learning. I enjoy exploring new topics, making lists, and diving into my favorite pastimes—whether it’s reading, watching films, listening to music, cooking, or spending time outdoors.
