# William Neumaier's INF6420 Project

A personal portfolio/information repository website to collect and maintain various aritstic projects, intitiatives, and created reference materials.

## WIREFRAMES

As a good plan is essential to developing a strong website, I have created a few top level wireframes showcasing the basic design concepts for each main page of my website.

Website Title - Will contain the title of my website/brand

Navigation Bar - Will include buttons that lead to the other pages such as about, projects, information, and contact

Recent Updates Bar - Will contain most recent updates to the site (projects, guides, functionality, etc.) in chronological order

Photo Carousel - Will cycle through photos of the chosen showcased art for that time

Footer - Contains buttons for "Contact Me" and a fast travel to the top button, also the copyright date.
